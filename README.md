# Nyx

Desktop apps for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), built with GTK 4 and Rust. They share
one look: a flat, monospace window that takes its colors from your Omarchy theme and
changes with it, fits a half-screen tile, and works from the keyboard.

## Install

Install the apps you want, or all of them:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/design-nexus/nyx/main/install.sh | bash -s -- music pdf
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/design-nexus/nyx/main/install.sh | bash -s -- all
```

Only the apps you name are downloaded. Archives are verified against the suite manifest.
Use `NYX_BUILD=1` for a source build. The installer adds what the apps need
from the Arch repositories, installs to `~/.local`, and adds the `nyx` command. Add
`--default` to make the apps open their file types.

```sh
nyx list                 # the apps, and which are installed
nyx install chat         # add another
nyx update               # install supported releases for installed apps
nyx uninstall chat       # remove one (--purge also removes its settings and data)
```

## Shared settings

The theme is shared: choose one in any app and the others follow. It is kept in
`~/.config/nyx/theme.toml`, and themes in `~/.config/nyx/themes/` are offered in
every app. Each app keeps its own settings in `~/.config/nyx-<app>/settings.toml`.

Notepad, Archive and Weather open as floating windows; their Hyprland rules are in
`~/.config/hypr/nyx.lua`.

## Building

```sh
bin/nyx dev setup
bin/nyx dev build music
bin/nyx dev test music
bin/nyx release check --structure-only
```

Source ownership and immutable shared dependencies are recorded in `suite.toml`.
[Core](https://github.com/design-nexus/nyx-core) contains the shared application,
account and sync foundation. [Design](https://github.com/design-nexus/nyx-design)
contains GTK widgets, themes, icons and playback controls. Its
[STYLE.md](https://github.com/design-nexus/nyx-design/blob/main/STYLE.md) is canonical.
The root Cargo workspace is retained only for rollback; active application work
belongs in the independent checkouts. [Release procedures](docs/RELEASES.md) cover
pinned build inputs, artifacts, CI and coordinated API changes.

## Multi-repository development

[Migration audit and rollout](MULTIREPO_MIGRATION.md) records the reviewed baseline,
repository boundaries, history-preserving commands, and all 24 independently released applications.
Shared workspaces: [Core](https://github.com/design-nexus/nyx-core) and
[Design](https://github.com/design-nexus/nyx-design).
Installation and updates use checksummed releases from the owning repositories.
Apps without a release yet are built from their repository at the revision `suite.toml`
pins. The pre-split monorepo is in this repository's history at `baseline`.

```sh
bin/nyx dev status
bin/nyx dev build archive
bin/nyx dev test archive
bin/nyx release check --structure-only
```

`suite.toml` pins repository revisions and application mappings. `.nyx-local.json`
(ignored) overrides local checkout locations. By default, `nyx dev setup` places
repositories beside this umbrella checkout (for example, `~/Projects/nyx-core`).
`NYX_DEV_HOME` selects a different clone directory. Source publication is recorded in
[the publication receipt](docs/migration/publication.json). `nyx release check`
checks supported releases, source compatibility, artifacts, and checksums.
Build inputs are pinned in `build-environment.json`; runtime/GUI/provider behavior
retains its existing contracts and is not exercised by routine migration checks.
